              <p>In this game, you will be randomly assigned one of three faction: Spacecrew, Impostor, or Neutral. If you are a Spacecrew, you can win by completing all tasks or by identifying and voting out the Impostors. As an Impostor, your goal is to eliminate everyone by killing them and deploying strategic sabotages to create chaos among the crew.
